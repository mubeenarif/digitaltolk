# My thought regarding original code
If we conside large sacle applications, the current code need improvements to structure it properly. The current code structue is difficult to scale and debug as code base increase.

# My Refactoring regarding the code
I have refactored the code by using the Modular approach, I have created a `Booking Module` with three controllers, i.e,
1. `BookingController`
2. `JobController`
3. `NotificationController`

Module-based development has a number of benefits, including:

1. Improved code reusability
2. Easy maintenance
3. Improved organization
4. Increased scalability
5. Reduce memory usage and improve performance

# Interfaces and Repositories
I have split the basic single repository into multiple repositories, i.e,
1. BookingRepositroy implements BookingRepositroyInterface 
2. NotificationRepository implements NotificationRepositoryInterface
3. JobRepository implements JobRepositoryInterface

Benefits of using multiple repositories with interfaces are:
1. Easy to scale and maintain.
2. This approach makes code more decoupled reducing dependencies of different components on each other.
3. Interfaces provide an abstraction layer hiding the implementation details, and provides the clear defination of the class
   and code becomes more readable and self-explanatory, as classes are explicit about their functionalities.
